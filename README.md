Based on AWS experience with over a million active customers, we standardized migration process into three phases of activities:Assess, Mobilize and Migrate&amp;modernize.
We understand that every migration is different; however, based on our experience with over a million active customers and helping organizations of all ages, industries, and geographies migrate to the cloud, we have seen a standardized migration process  take shape. This process can generally be broken into three phases of activities: 1) Assess, 2) Mobilize and 3) Migrate and modernize.
